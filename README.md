# Python projects

These are some of the projects I've made while learning python.

There are some more. They run on a tool called [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/). Check them out in the links below.

## Vocabulary

This program takes a list of **words** with their **meanings** as input and regularly notifies you with a _random_ word from the list to help you better remember the words. (**NOTE**: Make sure the code and text files are in the same folder.) Files include:

- vocab.py
- Various text files in the vocab folder.


## Wikipedia crawler

**NOTE:** This code was written in python3.

According to a study, if you keep clicking on the first legit link (excluding pronounciation and other such links) of any Wikipedia article, you ultimately end up on the article about Philosophy. (ofcourse, you can go further)

This study elimates loops present in the pages. Files included are:
- wikipedia_crawler.py


To run python code:
```
$python file_name.py
```

If you have installed multiple versions of python, then to run a code using python 3:
```
$python3 file_name.py
```
